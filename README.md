# Autonomy basics
Simulations going through basic localization and control techniques behind AI in robotics.

## Localization
Histogram filter infering an agents location after movement using environment readings and Bayesian probability.

## PID control
Control steering in a car going around a racetrack, keeping it on track through noise in motion commands and constant drift in steering angle.
