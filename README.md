# Autonomy basics
Simulations going through basic localization and control techniques behind AI in robotics.

## Localization
Histogram filter inferring an agent's location after movement using environment readings and Bayesian probability.
  
*TODO: Rewrite in C++, maybe make it a 3D space or add multiple sensors

## PID control
Control steering in a car going around a racetrack, keeping it on track through noise in motion commands and constant drift in steering angle.
